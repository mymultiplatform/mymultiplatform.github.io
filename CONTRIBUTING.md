# Contributing (Admin workflow)
- Only Admin1 / Admin2 should push directly.
- To add PDFs: place files in `public/pdfs/` and push. The `Build manifest` workflow will update `manifest.json`.
- GitHub web upload is OK: **Add file â†’ Upload files** inside `public/pdfs/`.
- GitHub Pages serves files at `/public/pdfs/<file>.pdf`.
